# **Focus Game Deck üöÄ**

[Êó•Êú¨Ë™û](./README.JP.md) | **English**

**A PowerShell script that automates your gaming sessions from start to finish, designed for competitive PC gamers.**

This script handles the tedious environment setup before you start playing (disabling hotkeys, closing background apps, etc.) and automatically restores everything after you're done. This lets you focus solely on your gameplay.

## **‚ú® Features**

* **üéÆ Automated Game-Specific Environments**: Automatically sets up and tears down a custom environment for each game based on your configuration.
* **üîß Generic Application Management**: Flexibly control any application with configurable startup and shutdown actions.
* **üîÑ Easy Extensibility**: Add new applications to manage by simply editing the configuration file - no code changes required.
* **üõ°Ô∏è Robust Design**: Includes comprehensive configuration validation and a cleanup process that ensures your environment is restored to normal even if the script is interrupted (e.g., with Ctrl+C).
* **‚öôÔ∏è Special Integrations**: Built-in support for:
  * **Clibor**: Toggles hotkeys on/off.
  * **NoWinKey**: Disables the Windows key to prevent accidental presses.
  * **AutoHotkey**: Stops running scripts and resumes them after the game closes.
  * **OBS Studio**: Launches OBS and automatically starts/stops the replay buffer when your game starts/ends.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites**

To use this script, you will need the following software installed:

* **PowerShell**: Comes standard with Windows.
* **Steam**
* **OBS Studio**: [Official Website](https://obsproject.com/)
  * **obs-websocket plugin**: Included by default in OBS v28 and later. Please ensure it is enabled in the settings.
* **\[Optional\] Clibor**: A clipboard utility.
* **\[Optional\] NoWinKey**: A tool to disable the Windows key.
* **\[Optional\] AutoHotkey**: A scripting language for automation.
* **\[Optional\] Luna**: (Or any other background application you wish to manage).

## **üíª Installation Options**

Focus Game Deck offers flexible installation methods to suit different user preferences:

### **Option 1: Executable Distribution (Recommended)**

* ‚úÖ Access to latest development features

## **üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design**

Focus Game Deck is built with a **lightweight, maintainable, and extensible** design philosophy:

### **Core Principles**

* **ü™∂ Lightweight**: Uses Windows native PowerShell + WPF, no additional runtime required
* **üîß Configuration-Driven**: All behavior controlled through `config.json` - no code changes needed for customization
* **üåê Internationalization-Ready**: JSON external resource pattern for proper Japanese character support
* **üì¶ Single-File Distribution**: Can be compiled to a single executable using ps2exe

### **Technical Stack**

* **Core Engine**: PowerShell scripts with comprehensive error handling
* **GUI Module**: PowerShell + WPF with JSON-based internationalization
* **Configuration**: JSON-based settings with validation and sample templates
* **Integration**: Native Windows APIs and application-specific protocols

For detailed architectural information, see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### **Build System & Distribution**

Focus Game Deck features a comprehensive three-tier build system:

* **üì¶ Automated Executable Generation**: ps2exe-based compilation to standalone executables
* **üîê Digital Signature Infrastructure**: Extended Validation certificate support with automated signing
* **üöÄ Production-Ready Pipeline**: Complete development and production build workflows
* **üìã Release Package Management**: Automated signed distribution package creation

**Build Scripts:**

* `Master-Build.ps1` - Complete build orchestration (development/production workflows)
* `Build-FocusGameDeck.ps1` - Core executable generation and build management
* `Sign-Executables.ps1` - Digital signature management and certificate operations

          }
      },
      "games": {

              "name": "Apex Legends",
              "steamAppId": "1172470", // Find this in the Steam store page URL
              "processName": "r5apex\*", // Check this in Task Manager (wildcard \* is supported)
              "appsToManage": ["noWinKey", "autoHotkey", "luna", "obs", "clibor"]
          },
          "dbd": {

              "appsToManage": ["obs", "clibor"]
          }
          // ... Add other games here ...
      },
      "paths": {
          // ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì Change these to the correct executable paths on your PC ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì
          "steam": "C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steam.exe",
          "obs": "C:\\\\Program Files\\\\obs-studio\\\\bin\\\\64bit\\\\obs64.exe"
      }
  }
```

* **managedApps**:
* Define all applications you want to manage. Each app has:
  * `path`: Full path to the executable (can be empty if only process management is needed)
  * `processName`: Process name for stopping (supports wildcards with |)
  * `startupAction`: Action when game starts ("start", "stop", or "none")
  * `shutdownAction`: Action when game ends ("start", "stop", or "none")
  * `arguments`: Optional command line arguments
* **games**:
* Add entries for the games you want to manage. The key (e.g., "apex", "dbd") will be used as the \-GameId parameter later.
* Set the `appsToManage` array to specify which applications should be managed for each game.
* **paths**:
* Set paths for Steam and OBS. Other application paths are now defined in `managedApps`.

## **üé¨ How to Use**

### **Using Executable Version (Recommended)**

Simply run the executable from command prompt or PowerShell:

```cmd
# Command Prompt
Focus-Game-Deck.exe apex

# PowerShell
.\Focus-Game-Deck.exe apex
```

### **Using PowerShell Script Version**

Open a PowerShell terminal, navigate to the script's directory, and run the following command:

```powershell
# Example: To launch Apex Legends
.\Invoke-FocusGameDeck.ps1 -GameId apex

# Example: To launch Dead by Daylight
.\Invoke-FocusGameDeck.ps1 -GameId dbd
```

### **General Usage Notes**

* Specify the GameId you configured in config.json (e.g., "apex", "dbd") as the parameter.
* The application will automatically apply your configured settings and launch the game via Steam.
* Once you exit the game, the application will detect the process has ended and automatically restore your environment to its original state.
* **GUI Configuration**: Use `Focus-Game-Deck-Config-Editor.exe` for user-friendly configuration editing.

## **‚ûï Adding New Applications**

The new architecture makes it extremely easy to add new applications to manage. Simply add them to the `managedApps` section:

```json
{
  "managedApps": {
    "discord": {
      "path": "C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\Discord\\app-1.0.9012\\Discord.exe",
      "processName": "Discord",
      "startupAction": "stop",
      "shutdownAction": "start",
      "arguments": ""
    },
    "spotify": {
      "path": "C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Spotify\\Spotify.exe",
      "processName": "Spotify",
      "startupAction": "stop",
      "shutdownAction": "none",
      "arguments": ""
    }
  },
  "games": {
    "apex": {
      "appsToManage": ["noWinKey", "autoHotkey", "discord", "spotify", "obs", "clibor"]
    }
  }
}
```

**That's it!** No PowerShell script changes required. The system automatically handles any application defined in `managedApps`.

## **üîß Troubleshooting**

1. **If the script fails to execute:**
   * Check PowerShell execution policy
   * Try running with administrator privileges

2. **If processes fail to stop/start:**
   * Verify path settings are correct in `managedApps`
   * Ensure applications are properly installed
   * Check that process names are correct (use Task Manager to verify)

3. **If the game doesn't launch:**
   * Verify the Steam AppID is correct
   * Ensure Steam is running

4. **If OBS replay buffer doesn't start:**
   * Verify OBS WebSocket server is enabled
   * Check WebSocket settings (host, port, password) are correct
   * Ensure replay buffer is configured in OBS

5. **Configuration validation errors:**
   * Check that all referenced applications in `appsToManage` exist in `managedApps`
   * Ensure required properties (path, processName, startupAction, shutdownAction) are present
   * Verify action values are one of: "start", "stop", "none"
