# **Game Launcher & Environment Watcher üöÄ**

[Êó•Êú¨Ë™û](./README.JP.md) | **English**

**A PowerShell script that automates your gaming sessions from start to finish, designed for competitive PC gamers.**

This script handles the tedious environment setup before you start playing (disabling hotkeys, closing background apps, etc.) and automatically restores everything after you're done. This lets you focus solely on your gameplay.

## **‚ú® Features**

* **üéÆ Automated Game-Specific Environments**: Automatically sets up and tears down a custom environment for each game based on your configuration.  
* **üîß Tool Integration**: Automatically controls the following tools and features:  
  * **Clibor**: Toggles hotkeys on/off.  
  * **NoWinKey**: Disables the Windows key to prevent accidental presses.  
  * **AutoHotkey**: Pauses running scripts and resumes them after the game closes.  
  * **OBS Studio**: Launches OBS and automatically starts/stops the replay buffer when your game starts/ends.  
* **‚öôÔ∏è Easy Configuration**: Simply edit the config.json file to add new games or toggle features on and off.  
* **üõ°Ô∏è Robust Design**: Includes a cleanup process that ensures your environment is restored to normal even if the script is interrupted (e.g., with Ctrl+C).

## **üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites**

To use this script, you will need the following software installed:

* **PowerShell**: Comes standard with Windows.  
* **Steam**  
* **OBS Studio**: [Official Website](https://obsproject.com/)  
  * **obs-websocket plugin**: Included by default in OBS v28 and later. Please ensure it is enabled in the settings.  
* **\[Optional\] Clibor**: A clipboard utility.  
* **\[Optional\] NoWinKey**: A tool to disable the Windows key.  
* **\[Optional\] AutoHotkey**: A scripting language for automation.  
* **\[Optional\] Luna**: (Or any other background application you wish to manage).

## **üöÄ Setup & Configuration**

1. **Download the Repository**: Clone or download this repository as a ZIP file.  
2. **Create Your Configuration File**:  
   * Make a copy of config.json.sample and rename the copy to config.json in the same directory.  
3. **Edit config.json**:  
   * Open config.json in a text editor and update the paths and settings to match your system.

   ```json
   {  
         "obs": {  
             "websocket": {  
                 "host": "localhost",  
                 "port": 4455,  
                 "password": "" // Set your OBS WebSocket server password here  
             },  
             "replayBuffer": true  
         },  
         "games": {  
             "apex": { // ‚Üê "apex" is the GameId  
                 "name": "Apex Legends",  
                 "steamAppId": "1172470", // Find this in the Steam store page URL  
                 "processName": "r5apex\*", // Check this in Task Manager (wildcard \* is supported)  
                 "features": {  
                     "manageWinKey": true,  
                     "manageAutoHotkey": true,  
                     "manageLuna": true,  
                     "manageObs": true,  
                     "manageCliborHotkey": true,  
                     "manageObsReplayBuffer": true  
                 }  
             }  
             // ... Add other games here ...  
         },  
         "paths": {  
             // ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì Change these to the correct executable paths on your PC ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì  
             "steam": "C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steam.exe",  
             "clibor": "C:\\\\Apps\\\\clibor\\\\Clibor.exe",  
             "noWinKey": "C:\\\\Apps\\\\NoWinKey\\\\NoWinKey.exe",  
             "autoHotkey": "", // Path to an AutoHotkey script you want to run after the game closes  
             "obs": "C:\\\\Program Files\\\\obs-studio\\\\bin\\\\64bit\\\\obs64.exe"  
         }  
     }
   ```

   * **games**:  
     * Add entries for the games you want to manage. The key (e.g., "apex", "dbd") will be used as the \-GameId parameter later.  
     * Set the boolean values in features to true or false to enable or disable specific automations for each game.  
   * **paths**:  
     * Ensure you set the correct **absolute path to the .exe file** for each application.

## **üé¨ How to Use**

Open a PowerShell terminal, navigate to the script's directory, and run the following command:

\# Example: To launch Apex Legends  
.\\GameLauncherAndWatcher.ps1 \-GameId apex

\# Example: To launch Dead by Daylight  
.\\GameLauncherAndWatcher.ps1 \-GameId dbd

* Specify the GameId you configured in config.json (e.g., "apex", "dbd") for the \-GameId parameter.  
* The script will automatically apply your configured settings and launch the game via Steam.  
* Once you exit the game, the script will detect the process has ended and automatically restore your environment to its original state.

## **üîß Troubleshooting**

1. **If the script fails to execute:**
   * Check PowerShell execution policy
   * Try running with administrator privileges

2. **If processes fail to stop/start:**
   * Verify path settings are correct
   * Ensure applications are properly installed

3. **If the game doesn't launch:**
   * Verify the Steam AppID is correct
   * Ensure Steam is running

4. **If OBS replay buffer doesn't start:**
   * Verify OBS WebSocket server is enabled
   * Check WebSocket settings (host, port, password) are correct
   * Ensure replay buffer is configured in OBS
