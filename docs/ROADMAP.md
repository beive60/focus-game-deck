## **Release Strategy and License Selection**

### **MIT License Strategic Value**

#### **Contribution to Community Formation**

MIT License provides strategic value beyond just a legal framework for this project:

* **Minimizing Participation Barriers**: Low restrictions allow other developers to easily propose bug fixes and feature additions
* **Reliability Assurance**: Complete transparency through open source builds social trust, especially for tools affecting gaming environments
* **Future Option Security**: Preserves developer's future freedom for commercial expansion or code reuse in other projects

#### **Alignment with Project Philosophy**

The guiding principle of "open and welcoming community" perfectly aligns with MIT License's high degree of freedom, forming the foundation for long-term project growth.

### **Official Distribution and Reliability Assurance Strategy**

Focus Game Deck, as a tool that particularly affects gaming environments, requires thorough reliability assurance.

#### **Integrity Assurance through Digital Signatures** ✅ **Infrastructure Completed**

* **Implementation Strategy**: ✅ Comprehensive code signing infrastructure for executable files implemented
* **Technical Requirements**: ✅ Extended Validation certificate support with RFC 3161 timestamped signatures
* **Distribution Chain**: ✅ GitHub Releases → Automated Build → Signed Binaries → End User Execution
* **Build System**: ✅ Master-Build.ps1 provides complete development and production build workflows
* **Certificate Management**: ✅ Automated certificate discovery, validation, and signing process

#### **Transparency Assurance Mechanisms**

* **Complete Source Code Disclosure**: All functionality implemented as open source
* **Build Reproducibility**: Users can independently build and verify results
* **Design Philosophy Documentation**: Complete documentation of risk management policies and design decisions

#### **Security Verification Process**

* **Static Analysis**: Comprehensive inspection using PowerShellScriptAnalyzer
* **Anti-cheat Testing**: Demonstrating 0% false positive rate in major games
* **Third-party Review**: Rigorous quality verification during alpha test period

**Design Philosophy Documents:**

* [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) - Detailed technical architecture + Risk management policy
* [docs/BD_and_FD_for_GUI.md](./BD_and_FD_for_GUI.md) - GUI specifications and design decisions + Security requirements

## **Project Vision**

"Provide an environment where all competitive PC gamers can focus 100% on victory with a single click"

Based on this vision, this roadmap defines the path to evolve Focus Game Deck from a simple tool into a complete application beloved by many users.

### **Phase 0: Preparation & Beta Launch**

* **Target Release**: v0.5 (Public Beta)
* **Target Timeline**: **~Mid-October 2025**
* **Goal**: Establish the project's "face" and "core" and release a practical version that can receive feedback from initial users.

| Major Feature | Priority | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Landing Page Creation** | **Critical** | Clear introduction site with tool value, setup instructions, and download links. Serves as base for promotional activities. |
| **GUI for config.json Creation** | **Critical** | Enable users to configure settings intuitively without fear of syntax errors. Without this, widespread adoption among general users is difficult. |
| **Invoke-FocusGameDeck.ps1 Refactoring** | **High** | Transition to config.json data-driven architecture. Resolve technical debt for future feature extensibility. |

### **Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization & v1.0 Official Release**

* **Target Release**: v1.0 (Official Release)
* **Target Timeline**: **~Late November 2025**
* **Goal**: Reflect beta feedback, expand coverage scope. Complete the first official version that can be confidently recommended to anyone.

| Major Feature | Priority | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Non-Steam Platform Support** | **Critical** | Support for Epic Games, EA App, Riot Client, etc. Essential feature for significantly expanding user base. |
| **Setup Wizard** | **High** | Complete basic configuration (Steam path, etc.) through interactive dialog on first startup. Minimize setup barriers to the extreme. |
| **Chinese/Korean Language Support** | **Medium** | Expand reach to huge Asian gamer markets. Consider translation cooperation from community. |

### **Phase 2: User Experience Enhancement**
