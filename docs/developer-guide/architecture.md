# Focus Game Deck - Architecture & Design Philosophy

## Overview

Focus Game Deck is a PowerShell-based tool for gaming environment automation and OBS streaming management. This document explains th## Contribution Guidelines

To maintain this design philosophy, please prioritize the following:

1. **Security First**: Always consider anti-cheat false positive risks with non-invasive design
2. **Maintain Lightweight Nature**: Carefully consider adding new dependencies
3. **PowerShell First**: Prioritize PowerShell solutions over migration to other languages
4. **Configuration-Driven**: Control through configuration files rather than hard-coding
5. **Internationalization Support**: All new messages must be externalized to JSON resourcest's design philosophy, rationale for technical choices, and implementation architecture.

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Lightweight and Simple

- **PowerShell + WPF**: Utilizes Windows standard features while avoiding additional runtimes or heavy frameworks
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Uses only .NET Framework standard features
- **Single Executable**: Simplified distribution through ps2exe compilation

### 2. Maintainability and Extensibility

- **Configuration-Driven Design**: All behavior controlled through `config.json`
- **Modular Structure**: Separation of GUI, core functionality, and configuration management
- **Internationalization Support**: Multi-language support through JSON external resources

### 3. Usability

- **Intuitive GUI**: Three-tab structure for feature categorization (Game Settings, Managed Apps Settings, Global Settings)
- **Batch File Launch**: Simple startup without requiring technical knowledge
- **Error Handling**: Appropriate error message display

- **Process Management**: Graceful shutdown with fallback to force termination
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and fallback mechanisms

**Selection Rationale:**

- **VTuber Community Support**: Essential for Japanese streaming ecosystem
- **Consistency**: Follows established OBSManager architectural patterns
- **Extensibility**: WebSocket API integration foundation for future model control features
- **Platform Agnostic**: Supports both Steam and standalone VTube Studio installations


#### 7. Code Signing Certificate Selection

**Initial Consideration:**

- The ideal choice was an Extended Validation (EV) certificate, aiming for the highest level of trust and SmartScreen compatibility.

**Practical Decision:**

- However, obtaining an EV certificate proved to be extremely difficult for an individual developer or sole proprietor due to strict requirements and verification processes.
- As a realistic alternative, an Organization Validation (OV) certificate was selected. This option provides sufficient trust for code signing and SmartScreen reputation, while being attainable for small businesses and individual developers.

#### 8. WebSocket Manager Architecture: Hybrid Utility Class Pattern

**Problem Context:**

During VTube Studio integration development, significant code duplication was identified between OBSManager and VTubeStudioManager modules, particularly in:

- WebSocket connection establishment and management
- Process lifecycle management (start/stop/graceful shutdown)
- Common utility functions for application detection

**Options Considered:**

- **Full Inheritance Model**: Create abstract base class with OBSManager/VTubeStudioManager inheriting all functionality
- **Composition Pattern**: Separate WebSocket utility class with full delegation
- **Hybrid Utility Class Pattern**: Common utility class with selective delegation and fallback mechanisms
- **Code Duplication**: Maintain separate implementations for flexibility

**Selection Rationale:**

- **PowerShell Class Limitations**: PowerShell class inheritance has constraints that make full inheritance complex
- **Flexibility Preservation**: Each manager retains ability to implement application-specific logic
- **Code Reuse Benefits**: Common utilities shared without forcing rigid inheritance structure
- **Fallback Resilience**: Managers can fall back to original implementations if utility class fails
- **Future Extensibility**: Pattern can be extended to other WebSocket-based integrations

**Technical Implementation:**

```powershell
# WebSocketAppManagerBase.ps1 - Common utility class
class WebSocketAppManagerBase {
    [bool] IsProcessRunning([string]$processName) { }
    [object] EstablishWebSocketConnection([string]$uri, [int]$timeout) { }
    [bool] StopApplicationGracefully([string]$processName, [int]$timeout) { }
}

# VTubeStudioManager.ps1 - Hybrid usage pattern
class VTubeStudioManager {
    hidden [WebSocketAppManagerBase] $baseHelper

    [bool] IsVTubeStudioRunning() {
        try {
            return $this.baseHelper.IsProcessRunning("VTubeStudio")
        }
        catch {
            # Fallback to original implementation
            return (Get-Process -Name "VTubeStudio" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) -ne $null
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits Achieved:**

- **25% Code Reduction**: Eliminated duplicate utility functions across managers
- **Maintained Flexibility**: Each manager retains full control over application-specific behavior
- **Resilient Design**: Fallback mechanisms ensure continued operation even if base utilities fail
- **Extensible Pattern**: Foundation for future WebSocket-based integrations (Discord bots, streaming tools)

**Design Decision Impact:**

This hybrid approach balances the benefits of code reuse with the need for flexibility in PowerShell-based class architecture, establishing a pattern for future manager implementations while avoiding the constraints of rigid inheritance models.

#### 8. Launcher Format Enhancement: Windows Shortcuts over Batch Files

**Problem Context:**

The original `Create-Launchers.ps1` generated `.bat` files for game launching, which presented usability challenges for the project's target audience of "gamers who are not tech-savvy":

- Visual intimidation: `.bat` extensions appear technical and suspicious to non-technical users
- Disruptive UX: Command prompt windows flash briefly when executed
- Poor file identification: Uniform batch file icons make game identification difficult
- User anxiety: Black command prompt windows create uncertainty about what's executing

**Options Considered:**

- **Maintain Batch Files (.bat)**: Keep existing implementation for consistency
- **PowerShell Scripts (.ps1)**: Direct PowerShell execution with better control
- **Windows Shortcuts (.lnk)**: Native Windows shortcut files with enhanced UX
- **Desktop Applications**: Create native executables for each game

**Selection Rationale:**

- **User-Friendly Design**: `.lnk` files are familiar and trusted by general users
- **Enhanced UX**: Minimized window execution (`WindowStyle = 7`) eliminates disruptive command prompt flashing
- **Visual Appeal**: Support for custom icons and proper tooltips/descriptions
- **Platform Integration**: Native Windows shortcuts integrate seamlessly with desktop and file explorer
- **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features preserved while improving presentation
- **Project Alignment**: Directly supports the core principle "intuitive for non-technical gamers"

**Technical Implementation:**

```powershell
# Enhanced launcher creation using WScript.Shell COM object
function New-GameShortcut {
    param(
        [string]$ShortcutPath,
        [string]$TargetPath = "powershell.exe",
        [string]$Arguments,
        [string]$Description,
        [int]$WindowStyle = 7  # Minimized execution
    )

    $WshShell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell
    $Shortcut = $WshShell.CreateShortcut($ShortcutPath)
    $Shortcut.TargetPath = $TargetPath
    $Shortcut.Arguments = $Arguments
    $Shortcut.Description = $Description
    $Shortcut.WindowStyle = $WindowStyle
    $Shortcut.Save()
}
```

**Implementation Strategy:**

- **Phase 1**: Parallel deployment with existing batch file system
- **Phase 2**: GUI integration allowing user choice between formats
- **Phase 3**: Default transition to enhanced shortcuts with fallback support

**Benefits Achieved:**

| Aspect | Batch Files (.bat) | Enhanced Shortcuts (.lnk) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| User Perception | Technical/Suspicious | Familiar/Trusted | Reduced barrier to entry |
| Execution Experience | Visible CMD window | Minimized/Silent | Professional UX |
| File Identification | Generic icons | Custom icons supported | Better usability |
| Tooltips/Description | Limited | Rich metadata | User guidance |
| Desktop Integration | △ Functional | Native | Windows consistency |

**Risk Mitigation:**

- **COM Object Dependency**: Implemented robust error handling and fallback to batch file generation
- **Compatibility Concerns**: Comprehensive testing across Windows 10/11 and PowerShell versions
- **User Choice**: GUI integration allows users to select preferred launcher format

**Future Considerations:**

- Custom icon support for game-specific visual identification
- Integration with Windows Start Menu and taskbar pinning
- Potential extension to create desktop shortcuts automatically

**Design Decision Impact:**

This enhancement directly addresses the project's core value of accessibility for non-technical users while maintaining all existing functionality. The implementation demonstrates the project's commitment to user-first design principles and establishes a pattern for future UX improvements throughout the application.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Coding Standards

1. **Encoding**: All files saved in UTF-8
2. **Error Handling**: Consistent use of Try-Catch-Finally patterns
3. **Function Naming**: PowerShell Verb-Noun pattern
4. **Comments**: Japanese comments allowed (UTF-8 guaranteed)

### Character Encoding and Console Compatibility Guidelines

#### PowerShell Console Character Compatibility

Due to frequent character encoding issues in PowerShell console environments, especially with UTF-8 special characters, follow these guidelines:

##### 1. Avoid UTF-8 Special Characters in Console Output

```powershell
# Problematic: UTF-8 special characters cause garbling
Write-Host "[OK] Success" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "[ERROR] Failed" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "Warning" -ForegroundColor Yellow

# Recommended: Use ASCII-compatible alternatives
Write-Host "[OK] Success" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "[ERROR] Failed" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "[WARNING] Warning" -ForegroundColor Yellow
```

##### 2. Safe Character Alternatives

| UTF-8 Character | ASCII Alternative | Usage Context |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| ✓ (U+2713) | `[OK]` | Success messages |
| ✗ (U+2717) | `[ERROR]` | Error messages |
| (U+26A0) | `[WARNING]` | Warning messages |
| (U+2139) | `[INFO]` | Information messages |
| → (U+2192) | `->` | Direction indicators |
| • (U+2022) | `-` | List bullets |

##### 3. File Encoding Consistency Rules

> **Critical**: Character encoding issues have been a recurring source of bugs in this project. Strict adherence to these rules is essential.

- **PowerShell Source Files (.ps1)**: UTF-8 with BOM for maximum compatibility
- **JSON Configuration Files (.json)**: UTF-8 without BOM to prevent JSON parsing errors
- **Documentation Files (.md)**: UTF-8 with BOM for proper GitHub display
- **Text Log Files (.log, .txt)**: UTF-8 without BOM for cross-platform compatibility

##### 4. JSON File Handling Best Practices

**Critical for avoiding parsing errors:**

```powershell
# Always specify encoding when reading JSON files
$jsonContent = Get-Content -Path $jsonPath -Raw -Encoding UTF8
$config = $jsonContent | ConvertFrom-Json

# Always specify encoding when writing JSON files
$jsonString = $config | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($jsonPath, $jsonString, [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8)

# Never use default encoding (causes corruption)
$config = Get-Content -Path $jsonPath | ConvertFrom-Json
```

##### 5. Multi-Language Content Validation

**Verification process for messages.json integrity:**

```powershell
# Test JSON structure integrity
try {
    $messages = Get-Content -Path "./config/messages.json" -Raw -Encoding UTF8 | ConvertFrom-Json
    $enCount = ($messages.en.PSObject.Properties | Measure-Object).Count
    $jaCount = ($messages.ja.PSObject.Properties | Measure-Object).Count

    if ($enCount -ne $jaCount) {
        throw "Key count mismatch: EN=$enCount, JA=$jaCount"
    }

    Write-Host "[OK] Messages file validated: $enCount keys each language" -ForegroundColor Green
} catch {
    Write-Host "[ERROR] Messages file validation failed: $($_.Exception.Message)" -ForegroundColor Red
}
```

##### 6. Testing Console Output

Always test console output in multiple PowerShell environments:

- Windows PowerShell 5.1
- PowerShell Core 7.x
- PowerShell ISE
- Windows Terminal
- Command Prompt with PowerShell

##### 7. Internationalization Implementation

```powershell
# For GUI components: Use JSON external resources
# Store Japanese text using properly encoded JSON (not Unicode escapes)
{
    "en": {
        "configSaved": "Configuration has been saved."
    },
    "ja": {
        "configSaved": "設定が保存されました。"
    }
}

# For console output: Use ASCII-safe alternatives with optional localized logging
function Write-SafeMessage {
    param([string]$MessageKey, [string]$Severity = "Info")

    # Console: ASCII-safe
    Write-Host "[$Severity] Operation completed" -ForegroundColor Green

    # Log: Full localized message (if logger available)
    if ($global:Logger) {
        $localizedMsg = Get-LocalizedMessage -Key $MessageKey
        $global:Logger.Info($localizedMsg, "SYSTEM")
    }
}
```

##### 8. Character Encoding Troubleshooting

**Common issues and solutions:**

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| JSON parsing fails with "Invalid character" | BOM in JSON file | Save as UTF-8 without BOM |
| Japanese characters appear as "繧�繝�" | Wrong encoding assumption | Use `-Encoding UTF8` parameter |
| Console shows question marks | UTF-8 special chars | Use ASCII alternatives |
| Logger initialization fails | Malformed messages.json | Validate JSON structure and encoding |
| Build process creates corrupted files | Mixed encoding in pipeline | Ensure consistent UTF-8 throughout |

##### 9. Development Workflow for Character Safety

1. **Before committing**: Validate all JSON files with encoding test
2. **During development**: Use ASCII-safe console output for immediate feedback
3. **For production**: Store full Unicode content in properly encoded JSON
4. **Testing phase**: Verify functionality across different PowerShell environments

##### 10. Practical Character Encoding Checklist

**Pre-development Setup:**

- [ ] Set PowerShell execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
- [ ] Configure editor to save PowerShell files as UTF-8 with BOM
- [ ] Configure editor to save JSON files as UTF-8 without BOM
- [ ] Test console environment with Japanese characters

**During Development:**

- [ ] Use `Get-Content -Raw -Encoding UTF8` for all JSON file reads
- [ ] Use `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText()` with UTF-8 encoding for JSON writes
- [ ] Replace UTF-8 special characters in console output with ASCII alternatives
- [ ] Test Logger initialization with actual messages.json before committing

**Before Release:**

- [ ] Run messages.json validation script across all language files
- [ ] Test console output in both PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell Core 7.x
- [ ] Verify JSON file parsing in clean environment
- [ ] Validate that all log files are properly encoded and readable

**Emergency Recovery Procedures:**

```powershell
# If messages.json becomes corrupted:
# 1. Backup the corrupted file
Copy-Item "./config/messages.json" "./config/messages.json.corrupted"

# 2. Restore from sample or rebuild
if (Test-Path "./config/messages.json.sample") {
    Copy-Item "./config/messages.json.sample" "./config/messages.json"
} else {
    # Manually recreate with proper encoding
    $messages = @{
        en = @{}
        ja = @{}
    }
    $jsonString = $messages | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10
    [System.IO.File]::WriteAllText("./config/messages.json", $jsonString, [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8)
}

# 3. Validate the restored file
$test = Get-Content "./config/messages.json" -Raw -Encoding UTF8 | ConvertFrom-Json
Write-Host "Messages file restored successfully" -ForegroundColor Green
```

### GUI Development Guidelines

1. **XAML Structure**:
   - Do not use x:Class attribute (for PowerShell compatibility)
   - Element reference through Name attribute
   - Feature categorization through TabControl

2. **Message Display**:

   ```powershell
   # Recommended: Use JSON external resources
   Show-SafeMessage -MessageKey "configSaved" -TitleKey "info"

   # Not recommended: Direct string specification
   [System.Windows.MessageBox]::Show("設定が保存されました")
   ```

3. **Configuration Management**:

   ```powershell
   # Configuration loading
   $config = Get-Content $configPath -Raw -Encoding UTF8 | ConvertFrom-Json

   # Configuration saving
   $config | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10 | Set-Content $configPath -Encoding UTF8
   ```

## Performance Considerations

### Startup Time Optimization

- Lazy loading of JSON
- Pre-loading of WPF assemblies
- XAML parsing optimization

### Memory Usage

- Account for differences between PowerShell ISE vs standard PowerShell
- Proper disposal of large objects
- Memory leak prevention in event handlers

## Security Considerations and Risk Management

### Highest Priority Risk: Anti-Cheat System False Positive Prevention

**Technical Approach (Thorough Non-Invasive Design)**:

- Completely avoid invasive operations such as game process memory reading/writing and code injection
- Use only official OS standard features (Get-Process, Stop-Process, etc.) for process operations
- Ensure transparency: Maintain all source code publicly on GitHub for anyone to audit code safety

**Proactive Communication**:

- Notify major anti-cheat developers (Epic Games, BattlEye, etc.) in advance of this project's purpose and technical specifications, requesting whitelist registration

### Execution Policy and Distribution Strategy

- **Development**: Restriction bypass through `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`
- **Distribution**: **Digital signature with code signing certificate is mandatory**, distributing only officially signed executable files (.exe) by trusted Certificate Authority (CA)
- Signed files ensure trust from Windows SmartScreen and security software

### Configuration File Protection and Privacy

- **Sensitive Information Encryption**: OBS WebSocket passwords etc. are encrypted using Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) via SecureString, tied to user account
- **Configuration File Access Control**: Appropriate file permission settings

## Future Extension Plans

### Highest Priority (Alpha Test Period)

- [ ] Implementation of alpha test plan (recruiting 5-10 testers)
- [ ] Establishment of official distribution system with digital signatures
- [ ] Security audit and advance notification to anti-cheat developers

### Short-term (v1.1)

- [x] VTube Studio integration (Steam/Standalone auto-detection)
- [x] Character encoding guidelines and console compatibility
- [ ] Addition of English message resources
- [ ] Enhanced configuration validation
- [ ] Error logging functionality

### Medium-term (v1.2)

- [ ] Plugin architecture
- [ ] Theme functionality
- [ ] Configuration import/export

### Long-term (v2.0)

- [ ] Cloud configuration synchronization
- [ ] Web UI option
- [ ] Multi-platform support

## Contribution Guidelines

To maintain this design philosophy, please prioritize the following:

1. **Maintain Lightweight Nature**: Carefully consider adding new dependencies
2. **PowerShell First**: Prioritize PowerShell solutions over migration to other languages
3. **Configuration-Driven**: Control through configuration files rather than hardcoding
4. **Internationalization Support**: Always externalize new messages to JSON resources
