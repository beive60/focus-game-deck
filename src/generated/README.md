# Generated Files Directory

This directory contains auto-generated PowerShell files created during the build process.

## XamlResources.ps1

**Generated by**: `build-tools/Embed-XamlResources.ps1`

**Purpose**: Contains embedded XAML UI resources as PowerShell Here-String variables.

**Usage**: This file should be dot-sourced before loading ConfigEditor classes to enable embedded XAML mode:

```powershell
. ./src/generated/XamlResources.ps1
. ./gui/ConfigEditor.ps1
```

**Variables**:
- All XAML files from `gui/` directory are embedded as `$Global:Xaml_<FileName>` variables
- Examples:
  - `$Global:Xaml_MainWindow` - Main application window XAML
  - `$Global:Xaml_ConfirmSaveChangesDialog_fragment` - Dialog fragment XAML
  - `$Global:Xaml_NewTabs_xaml` - New tabs fragment XAML
- Variable names are derived from file names with special characters replaced by underscores

**Note**: 
- This directory and its contents are excluded from version control (see .gitignore)
- The files are regenerated during each build process
- ConfigEditor automatically falls back to file-based XAML loading when these variables are not available (development mode)

## Why Embed XAML?

Embedding XAML as PowerShell variables provides several benefits:

1. **Single Executable Distribution**: No need to distribute separate XAML files
2. **Reduced Package Size**: Eliminates redundant file copies in release packages
3. **Simpler Deployment**: Users only need to download one .exe file
4. **Development Flexibility**: Source XAML files remain editable during development

## Build Integration

The Embed-XamlResources.ps1 script should be run early in the build process, before bundling and compilation:

1. Run `Embed-XamlResources.ps1` to generate this file
2. Bundle scripts (which will include this generated file via dot-sourcing)
3. Compile bundled scripts to executables
4. Copy other resources (XAML files are skipped)
5. Sign and package the release
